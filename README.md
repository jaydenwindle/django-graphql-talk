# Goodbye REST - Building APIs with Django and GraphQL

![it me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaydenwindle/django-graphql-talk/master/talk.jpg)


This repo holds the slides and the example code used in a talk I gave at the 
SF Django Meetup about how to build APIs using Django and GraphQL.

Disclaimer: The title of this talk is tongue in cheek - REST is great and you
probably don't need to re-write your whole API in GraphQL just because it's cool.
